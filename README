Encoder is an audio transcoding tool for the web build on node.js and redis.  It utilizes a simple drag and drop interface to upload files; the user can them download them directly in browser or receive an email with a link to download the file.
You can use it on safari, firefox, and chrome. 


Given an FFMPEG install using the configuration options I've provided, the app is certainly usable, however there are several optimizations/to-dos to be completed before I'll be satisfied with it.

In no particular order:

- extend database cleanup to other folders

- Progress bar implemented for ffmpeg conversion

- prettier email download page

- refactoring to be cleaner and more readable; ideally providing a simple API for devs
