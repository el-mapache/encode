Encoder is an audio transcoding tool for the web build on node.js and redis.  It utilizes a simple drag and drop interface to upload files; the user can them download them directly in browser or receive an email with a link to download the file.

Given an FFMPEG install using the configuration options I've provided, the app is certainly usable, however there are several optimizations/to-dos to be completed before it can be called fully functional.

In no particular order:

- Currently database cleanup is limited to one folder.

- A number of settings need to be added the the external configs file

- Progress bar implemented for ffmpeg conversion

- nicer looking email download page

-Codebase needs refactoring to be cleaner and more readable; eventually provide a simple API for devs


USAGE

3. create a configs.js in folder root
